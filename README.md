# SKG-IF JSON-LD Context

This repository contains the JSON-LD context for SKG-IF. The current (i.e., last) version available is copied in the root of the repository (`skg-id.json`). In addition, the other directories contain relevant information about the JSON-LD context, in particular:

* the folder `samples` contains the examples of use of the context for defining data related to the six kinds of entities the SKG-IF describes (i.e., agent, data source, grant, research product, topic, venue);

* the folder `scripts` contains programming scripts for performing several activities on the SKG-IF JSON-LD compliant data (e.g., the script for converting a JSON-LD file into RDF/Turtle);

* the folder `ver` contains all the versions of the JSON-LD context developed (and related samples within), to track the evolution of the context in time.
